# color-randomizer
Restful API that will display random colors

The goal of this project is to show the power of Restful interfaces.  The UI is all built in React and the backend is currently written in NodeJS.  
The next steps are to rewrite the backend in different languages so that the site can have any language as the backend that a user desires.
